# RPG Map Generator and Player
This Python script is an RPG map editor that allows the user to create and play thier own game.

The script starts with an **Editor** menu that allows the user to populate a **Map** with:
>
>**Things**, which can be
>>-**Items**
>>
>>-**Characters**, which can be
>>>-**NPC**s
>>>
>>>-**PC**s

Once placed in the **Map**, the attributes of the **Thing**s, including location can be revised. 

## As of 7/18/22:

after map creation and population, the user can choose to save the map and play the game as the **PC**. The **PC** can then
navigate rooms of the map and attempt to pick up the **Item**s or fight the **NPC**s in the room. The **PC** wins when all **NPC**s are deleted. 

The code is built to allow for changes in the future, which will allow the **PC** to use **Item**s, receive attribute modifiers from **Item**s.


# To Run this code:
    - install Python interpreter
    - use Python interpreter to run **hero_rpg.py**
